# World-Population-Problem
The world population database web application is developed using django. The application stores male, female, and child population of cities of each country. An authenticated user should be able to insert data to the database without refreshing the page using AJax and Jquery. Stored data should be vizualized using  bar graphs and graphs should be rendered dynamically.
Use Authenticated User as "dell" and Password as "pass123pass" or Register New User to post data into the database.
